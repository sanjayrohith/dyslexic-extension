Make sure both the icons are in the respective ratios:
- icon48.png (48x48)
- icon96.png (96x96)

Current state:
- Temporary 1x1 placeholder PNGs committed (to be replaced with real artwork).

TODO:
1. Replace placeholders with proper 48x48 and 96x96 designs (high contrast, accessible silhouette).
2. Provide licensing information for final icons (pending from Rohith).
3. Update manifest icons if additional sizes (128, 32) are added.

Notes:
- Keep file names consistent with `manifest.json`.
- Prefer SVG source stored separately; export PNGs for manifest.
- Ensure no trademarked or unlicensed assets are used.
