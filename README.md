## üõ† Activation Modes
| Mode | How It Works | Use Case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Left / Middle / Right Hold | Press & hold chosen button over a word for the configured hold delay. | Precise, intentional activation. |
| Auto (Hover) | Hover steadily over a word for the hold delay. | Hands-free exploration, low-effort reading. |

Hold delay and cooldown help prevent accidental triggers.

## üé® Visual & Readability Enhancements
- OpenDyslexic enforced for popup text (local font load + fallback).
- High-contrast background styles.
- Smooth scale/opacity animation; popup follows cursor while active.
- Planned (optional): syllable hints, phonetic support, reduced-motion mode.

## üîä Text-to-Speech
Triggered if TTS is enabled or if the response mode includes it. Uses `speechSynthesis` (availability and voices depend on OS / Firefox build).
