# Privacy Policy for Guardian Reader

Last updated: 2025-09-13

Guardian Reader is designed with privacy by default.

What we collect: Nothing. The extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data outside your device.

How it works:
- All processing (mouse/hover detection, word extraction, overlay rendering) happens locally in your browser.
- Preferences are saved using `browser.storage.local` and remain on your device.
- Text-to-Speech uses the system/browser speech engine; no audio or text is sent to external servers by this extension.

Third-party components:
- The OpenDyslexic font is bundled locally and licensed under the SIL Open Font License. No external font download is required.

Permissions:
- `storage` â€“ used only to persist your settings.

Contact:
- For questions or issues, open a GitHub issue in the repository: https://github.com/sanjayrohith/dyslexic-extension/issues

Changes to this policy will be committed to the repository with version history for transparency.
